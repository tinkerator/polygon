zappem.net/pub/math/polygon`. It can also be browsed on the
[go.dev](http://go.dev) website: [package
zappem.net/pub/math/polygon](https://pkg.go.dev/zappem.net/pub/math/polygon).

## Example

See the https://zappem.net/pub/project/polygons/ example.

## TODO

Here are some known issues potentially gating release of v1.0.0.

- None known. I'm using the code for a while to gain some confidence
  that I've not missed an important detail.

Some things to look into after v1.0.0.
